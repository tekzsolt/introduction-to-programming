# Major difference between Array & Hash is how they store the data.
# They are 2 different type of data structures: 
# The array stores the data in sequence with indexes starting from 0
# The hash stores the data in key-value pairs. All keys must be unique (generally symbols). In older versions of Ruby hash didn't keep an ordered structure.
